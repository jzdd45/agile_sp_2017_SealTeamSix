							I've been programming for five years. I have experience with various languages,
							including C++, Objective-C, Swift, Java, COBOL, and Visual Basic. I have experience
							with web design as well, including HTML, CSS, using JSP's, and JavaScript. Some of
							the environments I've coded in include Visual Studio, XCode, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

							Video games are what first got me interested in programming. Some of my current
							favorites are Madden 17, Fallout 4, Overwatch, Smite, and Halo Wars 2. The Madden
							franchise has always been a favorite of mine, as football is my favorite sport. It's
							pretty impressive how far the franchise has come from a programmers viewpoint.

							When I'm not working on homework or playing video games, I'm usually playing guitar
							or working out. I taught myself how to play guitar five years ago, around the same
							time I began programming. I play anything from The White Stripes to Bob Dylan. I've
							always been an active person, which is why I enjoy to workout. Right now, I'm playing
							running back for a semi-pro football team, so staying in shape is pretty important.
